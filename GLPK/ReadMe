This project runs the GLPK side of the model of gurung and ray. To choose between multicore CPU and single-core, uncomment/comment out the define statement "OMP" in "GPU_Tester.cu", and build. A pre-built version of both is provided uner GLPK.exe and mGLPK.exe, where m stands for multicore-enabled.

For eg to Run the Netlib benchmark number 7 in the paper with batch-size of 1000 LPs
using 10 streams   type the following command on the terminal (the script file BLPGSolver is executed which runs the executable in the folder bin)

 ./BLPGSolver 7 1 1000 10 1
 
 The name of the application is BLPGSolver to mean Batched LP Solver in GPU,
 1st Argument: Benchmark-Name -- The Benchmark Name to use, e.g. 'benchmark/256'
 2nd Argument: indicate the averaging number
 3rd Argument: indicate the size of batch i.e., the number of LPs to be solved
 4th Argument: not used here
 5th Argument: can be 1 to decides to execute the Netlib benchmarks and 2 to decide to choose random LPs of dimension as supplied by the 1st Argument
