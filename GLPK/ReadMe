This project runs the GLPK side of the model of gurung and ray. 

For eg to Run the Netlib benchmark number 7 in the paper with batch-size of 1000 LPs
using 10 streams   type the following command on the terminal (the script file BLPGSolver is executed which runs the executable in the folder bin)

 ./BLPGSolver 7 1 1000 10 1
 
 The name of the application is BLPGSolver to mean Batched LP Solver in GPU,
 1st Argument: indicate the benchmark number (option is 1 to 8 as presented in the paper)
 2nd Argument: indicate the averaging number
 3rd Argument: indicate the size of batch i.e., the number of LPs to be solved
 4th Argument: indicate the number of streams to be created, use 1 when batch-size is upto 100 otherwise 10
 5th Argument: can be 1 to decides to execute the Netlib benchmarks and 2 to decide to choose random LPs of dimension as supplied by the 1st Argument
